R# is a language and environment for GCModeller scripting 
and data science chart plot graphics. It is an Open source 
project which is similar to the R language and environment 
which was developed at R&D laboratory from BioNovogene 
corporation by Xie.Guigang. The R# language its language 
syntax is derived from the R language, and R# can be considered 
as a part of implementation of R on Microsoft .NET Framework 
environment. Although there are too many important differences 
between R# and R, but much code written for R could runs 
unaltered under R#.

Unlike the R Project, R# language is not focus on the 
statistical computing, R# try to combine the numeric computing 
with the .NET library programming which is comes from the 
GCModeller on the contrary. So in this way, R# provides a 
wide variety of bioinformatics analysis toolkit from 
GCModeller and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.

Authors of R#.

Since mid-2018 there has been a core group with write access to the R#
source, currently consisting of
