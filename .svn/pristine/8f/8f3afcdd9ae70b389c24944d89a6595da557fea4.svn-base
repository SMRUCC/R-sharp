                  Description:="GDI32.DLL exports Graphics Device Interface (GDI) functions that perform primitive drawing functions for 
                  output to video displays and printers. Applications call GDI functions directly to perform low-level drawing, text output, 
                  font management, and similar functions.
                  Initially, GDI supported 16 and 256 color EGA/VGA display cards and monochrome printers. The functionality has expanded 
                  over the years, and now includes support for things like TrueType fonts, alpha channels, and multiple monitors.",

    ''' The Escape function allows applications to access capabilities of a particular device not directly available through GDI. Escape calls made by an application are translated and sent to the driver 
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <param name="hdc">Identifies the device context.</param>
    ''' <param name="nEscape">Specifies the escape function to be performed. This parameter must be one of the predefined escape values. Use the ExtEscape function if your application defines a private escape value.</param>
    ''' <param name="nCount">Specifies the number of bytes of data pointed to by the lpvInData parameter.</param>
    ''' <param name="lpInData">Points to the input structure required for the specified escape.</param>
    ''' <param name="lpOutData">
    ''' Points to the structure that receives output from this escape. This parameter should be NULL if no data is returned
    ''' 
    ''' If the function succeeds, the return value is greater than zero, except with the QUERYESCSUPPORT printer escape, which checks for implementation only. If the escape is not implemented, the return value is zero. 
    ''' 
    ''' If the function fails, the return value is an error. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.
