 Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform.
 Computes the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform coefficients for a univariate or multivariate time series.
 
 The maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform is computed via the pyramid algorithm, using pseudocode written 
 by Percival and Walden (2000), p. 178. When boundary="periodic" the resulting wavelet and scaling coefficients 
 are computed without making changes to the original series - the pyramid algorithm treats X as if it is circular. 
 However, when boundary="reflection" a call is made to extend.series, resulting in a new series which is reflected 
 to twice the length of the original series. The wavelet and scaling coefficients are then computed by using a 
 periodic boundary condition on the reflected sereis, resulting in twice as many wavelet and scaling coefficients 
 at each level.

 wavelets: A package of functions for computing wavelet filters, wavelet transforms and multiresolution analyses.
 This package contains functions for computing and plotting discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) and maximal overlap 
 discrete wavelet transforms (MODWT), as well as their inverses. Additionally, it contains functionality for 
 computing and plotting wavelet transform filters that are used in the above decompositions as well as 
 multiresolution analyses.

 信号的奇异性检测         
 信号的突变点和奇异点等不规则部分通常包含重要信息。一般信号的奇异性分为两种情况：
 （1）信号在某一时刻其幅值发生突变，引起信号的非连续，这种类型的突变称为第一类型的间断点；   
 （2）信号在外观上很光滑，幅值没有发生突变，但是信号的一阶微分有突变发生且一阶微分不连续，这种类型的突变称为第二类型的间断点。
