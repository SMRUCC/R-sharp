    ' Abstract:

    '     Header file for the Performance Monitor data.

    '     This file contains the definitions of the data structures returned
    '     by the Configuration Registry in response to a request for
    '     performance data.  This file is used by both the Configuration
    '     Registry and the Performance Monitor to define their interface.
    '     The complete interface is described here, except for the name
    '     of the node to query in the registry.  It is

    '                    HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA.

    '     By querying that node with a subkey of "Global" the caller will
    '     retrieve the structures described here.

    '     There is no need to RegOpenKey() the reserved handle HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA,
    '     but the caller should RegCloseKey() the handle so that network transports
    '     and drivers can be removed or installed (which cannot happen while
    '     they are open for monitoring.)  Remote requests must first
    '     RegConnectRegistry().

    ' --*/

    '   Data Public Structure definitions.

    '   In order for data to be returned through the Configuration Registry
    '   in a system-independent fashion, it must be self-describing.

    '   In the following, all offsets are in bytes.

    '
    '   Data is returned through the Configuration Registry in a
    '   a data block which begins with a _PERF_DATA_BLOCK structure.
    '

    '   The _PERF_DATA_BLOCK Public Structure is followed by NumObjectTypes of
    '   data sections, one for each type of object measured.  Each object
    '   type section begins with a _PERF_OBJECT_TYPE structure.
