                  Description:="GDI32.DLL exports Graphics Device Interface (GDI) functions that perform primitive drawing functions for 
                  output to video displays and printers. Applications call GDI functions directly to perform low-level drawing, text output, 
                  font management, and similar functions.
                  Initially, GDI supported 16 and 256 color EGA/VGA display cards and monochrome printers. The functionality has expanded 
                  over the years, and now includes support for things like TrueType fonts, alpha channels, and multiple monitors.",

    ''' <param name="hdc">Identifies the device context.</param>
    ''' <param name="nEscape">Specifies the escape function to be performed. This parameter must be one of the predefined escape values. Use the ExtEscape function if your application defines a private escape value.</param>

    ''' <param name="lpInData">Points to the input structure required for the specified escape.</param>

    ''' Points to the structure that receives output from this escape. This parameter should be NULL if no data is returned

    ''' If the function succeeds, the return value is greater than zero, except with the QUERYESCSUPPORT printer escape, which checks for implementation only. If the escape is not implemented, the return value is zero.
